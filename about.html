			<b>The Drag Package Manager</b>
			<p class="about">
Wispux is a minimal, independent, source-based Linux distribution that uses the drag package manager.
Drag is written in Bash with the purpose of delivering a fast and customizable set of tools.
It fetches PKGBUILDs from Arch Linux's repositories and the AUR to
maximize package support. Drag makes editing PKGBUILDs easy in order to put the user in control of their system and it
features file tracking for installed packages, allowing for 
a clean removal process. Unlike most package managers, drag does not support automatic dependency resolution, however,
it can list the recommended dependencies of packages for you to install yourself.
			</p>
			<b>System Requirements</b>
			<p class="about">
Wispux is a source distribution built from scratch, so you must be comfortable with your computer specifications.
Building Wispux on old hardware can take a long time due to large packages like glibc and gcc.
Though I have built Wispux on a system with one procesor and 1 GB of RAM, so that isn't to say it's impossible.
Wispux has currently only been tested on x86 and x86_64 systems, but it may be compatible with other architectures with minimal modifications to the bootstrap.
The bootstrap follows a very similar path to LFS. This also means that it compiles Glibc, GCC, and other GNU tools. If you are opposed
to this or any other aspect of the bootstrap, feel free to edit it and make it your own. The installation guide doesn't recommend deleting your
cache until after the installation for safety purposes, so when following closely alongside the guide, it is recommended to have a hard drive of at least 20 GB.
Any help and suggestions for Wispux are greatly appreciated.

			<b>Initial Install</b>
			<p class="about">
Wispux compiles every package from scratch very similarly to LFS. Though thankfully, unlike LFS, much of it
is automated by the bootstrap.
The expected product of an initial install, unless customized further, would be a very
basic Linux system that doesn't even include a traditional init system. The standard Wispux
installation provides a minimal shell script at /sbin/init to start necessary services.
While surprising to some, this shell script is still very capable of running a
real desktop environment. Currently, I am writing this using my daily system (running Wispux)
configured to run modern applications such as Firefox, OBS, GIMP, Blender and others.

			<b>Comparisons</b>
			<p class="about">
Though I haven't given my package manager a true benchmark to compare to other
distributions, from personal experience I can say as a former Gentoo user that my drag package
manager does feel faster than Gentoo's portage when compiling, though keep in mind that this does not include dependency
resolution. This means that the time it takes to install large sets of packages may very well take longer
than you would expect on Gentoo since you must decide yourself which dependencies you wish
to install. I personally prefer this, since I feel that I have more
power and fine-tuned control over my system now. Gentoo's USE flags are genius and extremely efficient, but the
fundamental concept begs you to consider that the developers must create these flags
themselves and that not every possible USE flag for every possible package is going to be
considered, therefore proving drag a more customizable package manager. Gentoo is nevertheless an extremely
powerful and refined distribution, but Wispux does offer more fine-tuned control over your system if that is what you are looking for.

			<b>Is Wispux Right For You?</b>
			<p class="about">
There is no "best" distribution. Each distribution has its strengths and picking the right
one for you should be solely because of your personal preferences and needs in a system.
Like many other advanced distributions, Wispux is definitely not for the average Linux user.
Wispux is meant for people who have a deep understanding of Linux systems and manually
compiling packages to suit their needs. Compiling packages, even with the default
PKGBUILDs downloaded from Arch, will challenge you. You will run into all sorts of
compilation, configuration, and run-time errors. If you struggle to compile or get packages
to work on Gentoo or other source-based distributions, you will most definitely struggle harder on Wispux.
Now for those who understand how to compile and configure packages manually for your system, you may very
well find Wispux to be just what you've been needing.
