			<b>The Drag Package Manager</b>
			<p class="about">
Whispix is a minimal, source-based Linux distribution that uses drag to manage its packages.
Drag is written in Bash to deliver a fast and customizable set of tools.
It works by fetching the PKGBUILDs from Arch Linux's repositories and the AUR to
maximize package support. Drag encourages users to customize PKGBUILDs, resulting
in a more refined and tailored system. It features file tracking for installed packages, allowing for 
a clean removal of packages. Unlike most package managers, drag does not automatically resolve dependencies, though
it does list the recommended dependencies provided by Arch.
			</p>
			<b>Initial Install</b>
			<p class="about">
The initial installation process consists of three main
stages: the disk setup, bootstrap, and chroot. The expected end result, unless customized further, would be a very
basic Linux system that doesn't even include a traditional init system. The standard Whispix
installation provides a minimal shell script at /sbin/init to start necessary services.
While surprising to some, this shell script is still very capable of running a
real desktop environment. Currently, I am writing this using my daily system (running Whispix)
configured to run modern applications such as Firefox, OBS, GIMP, Blender and others.

			<b>Comparing</b>
			<p class="about">
Though I haven't given my package manager a true benchmark to compare to other
distributions, from personal experience I can say as a former Gentoo user that my drag package
manager does feel faster than Gentoo's portage when compiling, though keep in mind that this does not include dependency
resolution. This means that the time it takes to install large sets of packages may very well take longer
than you would expect on Gentoo since you must decide yourself which dependencies you wish
to install. I personally prefer this, since I feel that I have more
power and fine-tuned control over my system now. Gentoo's USE flags are genius and extremely efficient, but the
fundamental concept begs you to consider that the developers must create these flags
themselves and that not every possible USE flag for every possible package is going to be
considered, therefore proving drag a more customizable package manager. Gentoo is nevertheless an extremely
powerful and refined distribution, but Whispix does offer more fine-tuned control over your system if that is what you are looking for.

			<b>Is Whispix Right For You?</b>
			<p class="about">
There is no "best" distribution. Each distribution has its strengths and picking the right
one for you should be solely because of your personal preferences and needs in a system.
Like many other advanced distributions, Whispix is definitely not for the average Linux user.
Whispix is meant for people who have a deep understanding of Linux systems and manually
compiling packages to suit their needs. Compiling packages, even with the default
PKGBUILDs downloaded from Arch, will challenge you. You will run into all sorts of
compilation, configuration, and run-time errors. If you struggle to compile or get packages
to work on Gentoo or other source-based distributions, you will almost definitely struggle harder on Whispix.
Now for those who understand how to compile and configure packages manually for your system, you may very
well find Whispix to be just what you've been needing.
